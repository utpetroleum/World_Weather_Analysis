## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to add the weather description to the weather data retrieved from previous code. Then, add input statements to filter the data for weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester can choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, we create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
